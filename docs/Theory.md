# Theory of Lenses

**This section should cover: essential lens theory and 1 or 2 eye models **

## Essential Lens Theory

This section should make readers familiar with
- the [cardinal points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_point_(optics)) with standard + anatomy definitions [see here](https://www.bartleby.com/107/pages/page1019.html).
- construction of simple lenses [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens#Construction_of_simple_lenses)

## Models of the Eye

This section describes various models of the eye using general lens concepts introduced in the previous subsection. The flow of this section will be very similar to @navarroOpticalDesignHuman2009 where we look at:
1. cornea
2. lens
3. cornea and lens combined

### The Human Cornea

Following @navarroOpticalDesignHuman2009 we introduce the ideas behind:
- Gaussian optics
- Conic surface models @lotmarTheoreticalEyeModel1971
- Toric Lens @wikipediacontributorsToricLensWikipedia
- Biconic models (combined)

Additionally, we want to define the anatomy vocabulary:
- astigmatism in corneas
	- different types: such as oblique
- spherical aberration
- vertical meridian
- toricity (greater radius of curvature at the horizonal than at the vertical meridian) [see here]( https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-1313.1993.tb00428.x))
- sagitta z
