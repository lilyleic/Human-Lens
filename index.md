## Exploring Star Images Using Blender

When looking at stars, you may see something pointy. But... that can't be right. After all, stars are just big balls of gas (NASA hasn't exactly released any pictures of a big, pointy star in the middle of our solar system). But I've drawn stars as having bright yellow things with five points my whole life! What's going on?! 

Turns out, this is actually a well known phenomenon known as star images (add link?), and to see this effect, all you need is a fully dialated pupil, the cornea, and (most importantly!) the lens. In this project, we will be using Blender, an open-source modelling software, but before we can start building this system, we need to know a bit about how light works.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lilyleic/Human-Lens/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
